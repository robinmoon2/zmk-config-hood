# Hood Keyboard 

This repositorty is for a split bluetooth keyboard that use the ZMK firmware and the ergogen tool

## Tools : 

--> Create a table to add the tools used 

## Conception : 

The original conception has been made with ergogen that is a website to configure different keyboard by changing the key placements, the spacing and the number of keys. 

You can find my configuration in the .yml file : ... 

## Electronics : 

For this split keyboard I used a single pcb design for both side by flipping it. By chance, ergogen format the conception directly with the footprint and just need to make the rooting to have a better


## Printing : 

The issue with the Hood keyboard is that I re-shape the pcb and so is not conform anymore to the ergogen format made earlier. I used Fusion 360 to make a new 3D model and try to make a case to fit the keys, the battery and the microcontroler.

This step as taken me a lot tof time because not familiar with 3D printing


## Firmware : 

For the firmware I used the microcontroller nicenano!v2 that is a common microcontroler for keyboard. The advantage of it, it is compatible with ZMK firmware. A platform design to build single or split keyboards.
I encourage you to go see the ZMK firmware documentation right here to have better understanding or if you want to develop yourr own keyboard.


## Help / Ideas : 

Feel free to fork the project if you want to help with your design or ideas. It is always good to have feedback and advice on conceptions ! 

If you enconter a problem with the deployement of the code, you can open an issue.
